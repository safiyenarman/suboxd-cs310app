## Description
Choosing the right courses at Sabancı University often involves uncertainty. While flexibility in course selection is valuable, official course descriptions rarely reflect the real student experience such as instructor style, workload, and overall satisfaction.

Inspired by Letterboxd, a popular platform for reviewing movies, our project brings a similar concept to the academic world.  
We are developing a mobile application that allows students to rate, review, and share feedback on courses and instructors in one centralized, community driven space.  

The goal is to make course selection transparent, informed, and social turning academic feedback into a shared, engaging experience.

Students can:

•⁠  ⁠Log and review their completed or ongoing courses  
•⁠  ⁠Follow friends to explore their experiences  
•⁠  ⁠Discover trending and highly-rated classes  
•⁠  ⁠Build a personal “course diary” documenting their academic journey  

By promoting knowledge sharing and community interaction, the platform transforms course selection into a more enjoyable and collaborative process.
