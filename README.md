 # Introduction 
As students at Sabancı University, we are all familiar with the indecision and confusion that comes with choosing courses. The great flexibility we have in course selection, while a positive, can often lead to uncertainty, especially during the add-drop weeks. Relying solely on official course descriptions for information about content, instructor approach, and requirements can be misleading and often fails to capture the real student experience.

This constant search for reliable information often forces students to join numerous WhatsApp groups or constantly ask around, creating a fragmented and inefficient process. To solve this, we are developing a platform where students can share their experiences and opinions about courses. Our mobile application will allow users to provide ratings, write reviews, and share insights on specific courses and instructors in one centralized place.

This application will empower students to make more informed and confident decisions when selecting their courses. By providing access to authentic feedback from their peers, our platform goes beyond the syllabus to offer a realistic view of a course. This will help prevent misunderstandings and enable students to choose courses that truly align with their expectations. Ultimately, our project aims to foster a transparent and supportive environment within the Sabancı University community by facilitating genuine knowledge sharing and making the add-drop period smoother and less stressful for everyone.
