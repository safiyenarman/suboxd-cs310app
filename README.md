## Introduction
Choosing the right courses at Sabancı University often involves uncertainty. While flexibility in course selection is valuable, official course descriptions rarely reflect the *real student experience* such as instructor style, workload, and overall satisfaction.

Inspired by Letterboxd, a popular platform for reviewing movies, our project brings a similar concept to the academic world.  
We are developing a *mobile application* that allows students to *rate, review, and share feedback* on courses and instructors in one centralized, community driven space.  

The goal is to make course selection *transparent, informed, and social* turning academic feedback into a shared, engaging experience.

---

## Aim
The aim of this project is to build a *student centered course review platform* for Sabancı University.  
This application will help students make informed and confident course selections by combining *authentic peer insights* with *interactive, social features*.

Each course will have a dedicated page including details such as:
•⁠  ⁠Instructor name  
•⁠  ⁠Semester and credits  
•⁠  ⁠Course difficulty and workload level  
•⁠  ⁠Ratings and reviews from students  

This offers a *realistic perspective beyond the syllabus*.

---

## Description
The platform reimagines academic feedback as a *social experience* inspired by Letterboxd.  

Students can:
•⁠  ⁠Log and review their completed or ongoing courses  
•⁠  ⁠Follow friends to explore their experiences  
•⁠  ⁠Discover trending and highly-rated classes  
•⁠  ⁠Build a personal “course diary” documenting their academic journey  

By promoting *knowledge sharing* and *community interaction*, the platform transforms course selection into a more enjoyable and collaborative process.

## System Design
Our application is designed as a *social academic platform* where university students can log, rate, and review the courses they have taken, inspired by the concept of Letterboxd, a social platform for reviewing movies.  
The system aims to make academic experiences *shareable, **searchable, and more **engaging* through a user-friendly interface.

### Core Components

#### 1. User Profiles
Each user will have a personalized profile where they can:
•⁠  ⁠Add the courses they have taken or are currently taking  
•⁠  ⁠View their course list in a visual, timeline-like interface  
•⁠  ⁠Follow other students to see what classes they have taken and reviewed  

#### 2. Course Pages
Every course will have a dedicated page, similar to a movie page on Letterboxd:
•⁠  ⁠Course information: course code, instructor name, semester, credits  
•⁠  ⁠Average rating: displayed as stars and numerical scores (1–5)  
•⁠  ⁠Reviews: user-submitted text reviews  
•⁠  ⁠Tags: e.g., Project-based, Highly recommended, etc.  

#### 3. Review System
Users can:
•⁠  ⁠Write short or detailed reviews about courses  
•⁠  ⁠Rate courses based on difficulty, workload, etc.  
•⁠  ⁠Edit or delete their own reviews  
•⁠  ⁠Vote on other reviews they find helpful  

#### 4. Course Discovery
An explore page allows users to:
•⁠  ⁠Search courses by name or instructor  
•⁠  ⁠Sort courses by popularity, difficulty, or rating  
•⁠  ⁠View recommended courses based on similar departments  

#### 5. Social Interaction Features
To enhance engagement:
•⁠  ⁠Users can follow friends or classmates  
•⁠  ⁠A feed will show recent reviews from followed users  
•⁠  ⁠“Like” or “Save” features allow users to favorite reviews or courses  

### System Flow
1.⁠ ⁠User signs up or logs in  
2.⁠ ⁠User searches for a course and adds it to their “course diary”  
3.⁠ ⁠User leaves a review or rating for that course  
4.⁠ ⁠Reviews appear publicly on the course page and in followers’ feeds  
5.⁠ ⁠Other users interact (like, comment, follow)  

This flow ensures the app feels *social, **informative, and **interactive, while helping students make **better-informed course decisions*.

## Expected Outcome
This platform aims to make *course selection at Sabancı University easier, more transparent, and less stressful*.  
By centralizing authentic student insights, it replaces fragmented communication channels such as WhatsApp groups with a reliable academic feedback network.

Ultimately, the project:
•⁠  ⁠Encourages informed decision-making  
•⁠  ⁠Promotes trust and transparency  
•⁠  ⁠Fosters a stronger, supportive academic community
